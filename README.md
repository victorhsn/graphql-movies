# GraphQL - Graph Query Language

This repository was created to show how GraphQL works. It's a simple example. I just created the GraphQLServer using [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga). 

- graphql-yoga 
- yarn (package manager)

## Install 

First of all, you need to clone the repository from the github:

`
git clone https://github.com/victorhsn/graphql-movies
`

After that you need to access the path graphql-movies as below,

`
cd graphql-movies
`

Finally, install the dependencies and run the project
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

After installed the project will run the GraphQLServer at http://localhost:4000/ that you can access it from the browser to open the Playground and execute the Query/Mutation.
